# K-Means

## Overview

This is a project for a subject called "Aprendizaje Autom√°tico II" (Machine Learning II) that accounted for 15% of the final grade. It was made by a team of 2 people. The submission took place on Monday, the 10th of March of 2025, and earned a grade of 10 out of 10 points.

## Project Summary

For this project we had to write the K-Means algorithm from scratch in Python and then use it to cluster some synthetic blobs of data. It was implemented in the `KMeans` class in the [`kmeans.py`](/kmeans.py) file. We aimed to make it as efficient as possible by using NumPy and parallelism.
